// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
// I took terrible notes, apologies these aren't more direct with what you said.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysis = "This is the second step, where the team will determine, identify, and document expectations for the project in a more detailed scope, taking into account possible issues."
const design = "This is the third step - where the Developer(s) will work on implementing ideas and concepts into coding language across all scopes, whether it's a larger scale or detailed."
const implementation = "Onboarding/installation of the project"
const testing = "Double checking and testing functionality between all involved units, systems, etc., as well as performance, expectations, etc."
const maintain = "Ironing out bugs/errors that may present in unique situations & continued development between updates in languages and systems used to avoid obsolescence."
